The motivation for our project came from our informatics teacher.
We created this page for a good grade and because we want to make this planet a little bit better than before!
Our project converts your simple plain syntax into the complex Johnny Code.
Example:

000: INC 010
001: INC 010
002: INC 010
003: INC 010
004: DEC 010

Turns into:

7010
7010
7010
7010
8010

It's very easy to use and understand.
On the left input field, you insert your plain text and click on the "convert!" Button to convert your code.
You can access your converted code on the right side. Either you copy it manually or you use our "copy to clipboard" button with a fancy icon.
But instead of copying it, you could download the output as a .ram file and open it directly with the Johnny Simulator.

We wish you a lot of fun with our project.
